KeyGen2:
1. Remove URLs from the protocol
2. Remove "publicKey" from "clientEphemeralKey" and "serverEphemeralKey". JWK suffice!
3. Remove request signatures (too much and no major advantage)
4. Remove virtual environment (too complex)

Remove test directories.  Put these on a specific path using the same package names
as the real classes to make it more in line with other systems.  Put the tests in a
specific JAR as well?
